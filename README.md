# Gem-Store

This was an in class project where we worked as a team. We built a website  utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and we used Angular JS as a framework. The application registers new users and allows current users to sign in. It takes json data that I created and inserts the relavent information into the page. In addition, it allows users to input reviews on the products and provided all the required fields are entered correctly, the reviews are then sent to firebase where they are stored.
